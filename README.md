# Neural Network Tutorials
Setting up a repo to build up a library of neural network tutorials with just python and numpy. Followed in order, the tutorials should give a thorough and clear understanding of how networks are implemented and fine-tuned. Work in progress. 

## 1. Single Layer Perceptron 
A single layer perceptron implementation performing a binary classification task (sorting samples into two buckets). This is the simplest form of the artificial neural network (ANN), and a great way to understand [backpropagation and gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation).
