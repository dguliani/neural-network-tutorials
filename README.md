# Neural Network Tutorials
Setting up a repo to build up a library of neural network tutorials with just python and numpy. My hope is that when followed in order, the tutorials will give a thorough and clear understanding of neural network implementation and fine-tuning. This is a work in progress. 

## 1. Single Layer Perceptron 
A network with just one neuron performing a binary classification task (sorting samples into two buckets). This is the simplest form of an artificial neural network (ANN), and a great way to understand [backpropagation and gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation).
